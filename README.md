#### Allowed Mods



* SpeedRunIGT[Mod Version/s: [7.2.0](https://github.com/RedLime/SpeedRunIGT/releases/tag/7.2)] (Minecraft Version/s: All Versions)
    * Runs that use the SpeedRunIGT mod will utilize those times primarily, with adjustments made in case some minor bugs are found, or in cases of time removal for significant in-game lag. Top RSG run retiming will also use the splits given by the mod to calculate the final board time. You may use the option to only show 0-2 decimal places, but you must submit with the full 3 decimal places. Copy and paste the text within "igt_timer.log" (in the saves folder for the PB) into your run submission description is encouraged.
* Atum[Mod Version/s: [1.0.5](https://github.com/VoidXWalker/Atum/releases/tag/v1.0.5)] (Minecraft Version/s: All Versions)
